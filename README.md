#  Handwritten Character Recognition using EMNIST  

A comparative study of five different machine learning and deep learning models for handwritten character recognition using the EMNIST dataset. The project evaluates the performance of K-NN, SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and CNN models.

Features:
✅ Multiple Models: K-NN, SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, CNN
✅ Hyperparameter Tuning: Variations in k (K-NN), C (SVM), epochs, dropout (CNN), etc.
✅ Dataset: Uses EMNIST for handwritten character recognition
✅ Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
✅ Comparative Analysis of different models

Dataset:
EMNIST (Extended MNIST): A dataset containing handwritten characters and digits.

Results
Performance comparison of all models on EMNIST dataset
Impact of hyperparameter tuning on accuracy
